## About
![Apple Airpods Page](https://github.com/marwan-elgendy/Apple-Product-Page-Animation/blob/main/Media/Airpods.png)


   
In This small project I try to recreate the animations in the product page of the Apple Airpods [Click Here to see Apple Airpods Page](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/).   
I'm using a video as a background and tracking scroll position to get through the video with a bit of delay to make it as smooth as possible.

## Problems
Using a Video made the experience bad and not smooth at all.
##### I will Use Canvas in another Project to solve this problem
