# Apple-Product-Page-Animation

## About
In This small project I try to recreate the animations in the product page of the Apple Airpods.   
I'm using a video as a background and tracking scroll position to get through the video with a bit of delay to make it as smooth as possible.

## Problems
Using a Video made the experience bad and not smooth at all.
##### I will Use Canvas in another Project to solve this problem
